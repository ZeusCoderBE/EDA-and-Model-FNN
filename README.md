# Weather Prediction Project

## Purpose
This project aims to analyze weather data and build models to predict weather factors such as maximum temperature and the likelihood of rain tomorrow.

## Project Structure
1. **Python Notebook:** The project utilizes a Python notebook to perform all data analysis and model building tasks. The notebook file is named `Weather_Prediction.ipynb`.

2. **Data:** The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `weatherAUS.csv`. This dataset contains approximately 10 years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia, including 145460 records and 23 attributes.

3. **Libraries Used:**
   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn
   - TensorFlow (Keras)

4. **Tasks Covered in the Notebook:**
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and visualize relationships between variables.
   - Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, outlier removal, data standardization, and encoding categorical variables.
   - Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for regression to predict maximum temperature.
   - Building an ANN model for classification to predict the likelihood of rain tomorrow.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
   
5. **Instructions for Running the Notebook:**
   - Ensure that all required libraries are installed in your Python environment.
   - Download the `weatherAUS.csv` dataset and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
   - Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible platform.
   - Execute each cell in the notebook
